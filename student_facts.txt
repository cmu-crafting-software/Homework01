Dietrich 2024
I took Intro to Python in undergrad, and have taken a bunch of ML courses at
CMU in which I wrote in Python. For other courses and my research, I've used
R. Stata is a program that is popular with economists, but it's mostly a
scripting language with some rudimentary programming elements.
I like to play the tuba.
