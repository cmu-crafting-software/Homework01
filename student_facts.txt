Wode "Nimo" Ni - ISR, SCS 4th year Ph.D. student
I used many languages in the past, including C++, OCaml, and Haskell.
Nowadays my main languages are: Typescript, Domain, Subbstance, and Style.
The last three I developed and am still maintaining for the Penrose
diagramming platform! 
I spend 10~20 hrs playing pool every week. Perhaps just a little more
serious about pool versus work.
